Note that while field filtering, field expansion, and limiting will work with these multiple-ID lookups, you will get an error if one of the objects does not have any of the requested fields. For example, if you were to lookup a Page and a User using this method, and then filter on fields=id,picture,gender the request would fail because Pages do not have a gender field.
